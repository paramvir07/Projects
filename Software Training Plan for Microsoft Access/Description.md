This project is created as a learning program aimed at helping company employees understand and utilize Microsoft Access for information management, using Adidas as 
a hypothetical company scenario. In simple terms, it teaches employees how to organize, store, and find data effectively. They'll learn to create databases, enter
and change information, and ask questions to get specific answers from their data. The training also covers making forms and reports, which are like easy-to-read 
summaries of the data. By the end of the training, employees will feel more confident using Microsoft Access to do their jobs better.
