I collaborated with my teammates to build a Java app for users to book their movie tickets and access their ticket details.
In my movie booking app, users start by entering their phone number, which generates a unique token.
With this token, they proceed to select the movie they want to watch and specify details such as the city, cinema, date, and time.
After selecting their seats from the seating layout, users confirm their choices.
At the payment stage, various payment methods are available for selection.
Once payment is confirmed, users are prompted to enter their phone number again for verification. 
Finally, the app displays the ticket details, including movie information, cinema location, seat numbers, and payment confirmation.
This streamlined process ensures a hassle-free movie booking experience for users.
