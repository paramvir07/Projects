I developed a Java application leveraging an API to facilitate its functionality.
My quiz app named Brainy Buzzer offers users an engaging and seamless quiz experience.
It starts with simple instructions to help users navigate easily, followed by a details page where user can  customize their quiz difficulty.
Once users enter the quiz, they encounter a diverse range of questions across various topics.
Upon completion, they receive instant feedback in the form of a final score.
It's a straightforward and enjoyable way to learn and test knowledge.
